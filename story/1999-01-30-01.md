 As a teacher and as a reader, I love finding new books that I can share with my students. I have made lists of books that I want to read, and one of them was _Flowers for Algernon_, by Daniel Keyes.

If you are not familiar with the book, it is about a man named Charlie who has an IQ of about 60. He is teased and he is neglected, and he wishes he were different. Then, he has the opportunity to undergo an experimental procedure—a procedure found to be successful when performed on a mouse named Algernon—that could improve his intelligence and help him become who he wanted to be.

On the surface, I thought this sounded intriguing. Well…it was, indeed, intriguing and well-written good qualities, I admit); but those are the only positive things to be said about _Flowers for Algernon_. I am a relatively optimistic person who enjoys happy endings to stories, _especially_ when it is about an underdog who needs to be uplifted. Alas, this one let me down.

It was almost comical how depressed it made me. Nate came home, looked at me, and said, “What’s wrong with _you_?” I had to look at him pitifully and say, “It’s the stupid book.” Then, he smiled and said, “Didn’t get your happy ending, huh?”

Nope.
