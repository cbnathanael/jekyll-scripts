<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a teacher and as a reader, I love
finding new books that I can share with my students. I have made
lists of books that I want to read, and one of them was _Flowers for
Algernon_, by Daniel Keyes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you are not familiar with the book,
it is about a man named Charlie who has an IQ of about 60. He is
teased and he is neglected, and he wishes he were different. Then, he
has the opportunity to undergo an experimental procedure—a
procedure found to be successful when performed on a mouse named
Algernon—that could improve his intelligence and help him become
who he wanted to be.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the surface, I thought this sounded
intriguing. Well…it was, indeed, intriguing and well-written (good
qualities, I admit); but those are the only positive things to be
said about _Flowers for Algernon_. I am a relatively optimistic
person who enjoys happy endings to stories, _especially_ when it is
about an underdog who needs to be uplifted. Alas, this one let me
down.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was almost comical how depressed it
made me. Nate came home, looked at me, and said, “What’s wrong
with _you_?” I had to look at him pitifully and say, “It’s the
stupid book.” Then, he smiled and said, “Didn’t get your happy
ending, huh?”</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nope.</P>
